        <h2>Backtracking </h2>
       <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion. </p>
       <P>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of option; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; you didn't, it isn't.</P>
       <P>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree, the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are as good or a bad You want to get to a good leat. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf  .  </P>
       <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leal by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found    .</p>
       <p>This needs an example,</p>

<ol>
<li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>

<li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>

<li> C is bad. Go back to A.</li>

<li>At A, you have already tried C, and it falled. Try D.</li>

<li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>

<li> At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>

<li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>

<li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>

<li> E is good. Congratulations!</li>
      </ol>
  <fieldset style="background-color: rgb(227, 230, 232);" > <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices, we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching).</p>

        boolean solve(Node n){
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            } else{
                for each child c of n{
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false

       <p>
        Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If
        
        solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, noden is one of the nodes on a path from the root to
        
        some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p> </fieldset>
        <h3>How does this work?        </h3>
        <ul >
            <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable  .   </li>
            <li>If no child of n is solvable, then a is not solvable .</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal nodel, all you have to do is test whether any child of his solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines .</p>
            <fieldset><pre style="color: dodgerblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
            for each child of n {
                 it sovels succeeds, return true
            }
            return false
</fieldset>
            </pre>
            <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node, if the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case in the above code, this is done by the lines
            </p><fieldset>
            <pre style="color: dodgerblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
                if n is a leaf node {
                    if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                    else return false
                }

                </pre>

                <p>The backtracking gonthm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>To search a tree:</b></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
                <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
                <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>
                <fieldset><pre style="color: dodgerblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
    boolean solve(Node n) {
        put noden on the stack;
        while the stack is not empty{
            if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
                if it is a goal node, return true
                else pop it off the stack
                }
                else{
            if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
               push the next untried child onto the stack
                 else pop the node off the stack
                }
            return false
     } 
                </pre></fieldset>
                <p>
                    Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the noge currently on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.
                </p>
                <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order a path from the root to a goal node.
                </p>
                <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive cats. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or storing it in an array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:
                    </p><fieldset>
                    <pre style="color: dodgerblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
    boolean solve(Node n) {
      if the leaf is a goal node{
         print n
         return true
         }
      else return false
      }else{
         for each child c of n{
            If solve(c) succeeds{
              print n
               return true

                    <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
                    <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
                    </p>
                    <p>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions,
                     </p>
                     <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods in a chess game, for example, you could test Whether a node is a leat by writing a<b> gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it <b> isLeaf).</b> This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
                    </p>
                    <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have been the already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying<b> for each child c of n.</b>  in reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children ace, and there may be no obvious way to step through them in chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some plece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?
                    </p>
                    <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children and you can return "failure" This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work
                    </p>
                    <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, you might be able to number the<b> children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tred<b> child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1, </b>and you have not yet tried children<b> k+1 </b>through<b> n.</b> Or if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try<b> red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow fais, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right<b> (or perhaps north, east, south, west).</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>it isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. In the chess game example, you might number your pieces for perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order, but in addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered.
                    </p>

                    </h3>
                    <P>
                        For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.
                        </P>
                        <P>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the loot node. Each node can reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called it's children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.
                        </P>

                                One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next, as far as you know, both the left and the night chip are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion

Either of these methods could have exponential growth Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choicesi, do so!.

                                            </h3>
                                            <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routinies.
                                            </p>
                                            <h3>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.
                                            </h3>
                                            <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones) You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries Indepting to show the level of nesting can help.                                            
                                            </p>
                                            <h3>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.
                                            </h3>
                                            <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs the proportions will be better.

                                                <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to your manager) You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every retumlyestnode)) with return(true), and every retum(nomode)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,

                                                <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about making your code larger, modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded.

                                                <P>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending in the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following code.

                                                <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves:
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approach.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                First, notice that if a marble has a move that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump, if it can jump It cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marole occupies a unique space, Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possibile from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place:
                                                </p>
                                                <p><b>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:
                                                </b></p>
                                                <ul >
                                                    <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>if the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
                                                    <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left
                                                    </li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>We write another method<b> int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position) </b>that will take a board and a position, make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity) in technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative rather than "mutative.
